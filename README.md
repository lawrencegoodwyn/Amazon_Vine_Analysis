# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis was to see if there was an impact on the percentage of "5-star reviews" left on Amazon appliance products from regular users vs. Amazon's "Vine Program" users--users that get paid upon reviewing an Amazon product. After extracting, transforming, and loading the appliance .csv, the data was reduced to only look at reviews in which the number of "helpful votes" upon the review was calculated to be greater than 50% of the total votes.

## Summary

It seems to be more likely for Amazon vine users to leave a 5-star review. The 12% difference between non-vine user and vine-users is quite large and would most likely be replicated with further analysis. However, before a definite decision is made as to whether or not getting paid for a review makes a reviewer more likely to leave a 5-star review is done, it would be wise to get a larger sample of vine-users. Doing something as simple as analyzing another product set of data would work.
